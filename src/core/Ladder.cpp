	Ladder
	------

	Ladders are flexible objects which connect two different Locations on different Levels, but may also connect
	different levels of the same Location.  When connecting different Locations, those Locations must be on the
	Fore Layer, and the Ladder must be wrapped by a LadderTransit and placed on the Back Layer.  When connecting
	two levels within the same Location, the Location can be on either Layer, but must obviously be more than
	one level high.

	Ladders can be extended or retracted through world-owned interaction points, typically represented by
	a physical Button at the base and an interaction point at the top.

	Ladders may span multiple levels, and pass behind Locations.  The requirement is that for the Locations that
	they connect, the Cells they connect on have a floor (either the ground, or a Walkway).

	Ladders may have multiple Agents on them, but they must all be travelling in the same direction.

	Construction arguments:

	- cellX and cellY are global, not relative to the Location that it's in.
	- levelsHigh is the number of levels that the Ladder spans.  So a Ladder joining Levels 0 and 1 will have a levelsHigh of 2
