// Live Agent group membership counts, for ticket #111.
//
// A count is asked through the public World API and answered from the
// World's own authoritative state: the Agents themselves, each carrying
// the Agent group ID it was assigned. Nothing here reads a counter, because
// there is none - not on the group, not in the panel, not in the file. That
// is the whole design, and most of what these checks pin down.
//
// What gets pinned down:
//
//   a count covers every World-owned Agent carrying the group's ID,
//   whichever Layer and Sector it sits in and whichever movement state it is
//   in - idle, walking, or held waiting at a Door it cannot open
//   ungrouped Agents and the members of other groups are never counted, and
//   an empty group counts zero rather than going missing
//   a count is current the moment an assignment is made: assigning,
//   reassigning and clearing each move it by exactly one, with no refresh
//   step for a caller to remember and nothing to make the number settle
//   renaming a group leaves its count alone, because the count follows the
//   ID and the name is only a label read back through the World
//   removing an Agent takes it out of its group's count, so a count cannot
//   outlive a member the World no longer has
//   the serialized document carries group definitions and per-Agent
//   assignments only: no count-shaped field exists anywhere in them, so no
//   written-down number can go stale, and a round trip rebuilds every count
//   from the memberships that came back
//   an undo snapshot restores the memberships and the counts with them, and
//   carries no count data of its own either
//   the real Groups table declares the Agents column and renders inside a
//   CPU-side ImGui context without leaking a disabled scope, paused or
//   running
