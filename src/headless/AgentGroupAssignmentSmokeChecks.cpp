// Assigning Agents to Agent groups, for ticket #110.
//
// Everything here crosses the same two seams the group definitions did in
// #109: the public World authoring API, and a complete World
// serialize/deserialize round trip. The registries behind the API are never
// inspected, and the YAML is read as a whole document - never asserted
// against incidental formatting.
//
// What gets pinned down:
//
//   every Agent starts with no Agent group, and so does every Agent read from
//   a document that never carried the assignment field
//   assigning and clearing go through World, and an unknown Agent or an
//   unknown Agent group is refused with a reason and changes nothing
//   the assignment is a reference to stable identity: renaming the group
//   moves the label every assigned Agent shows and leaves the reference alone
//   version 9 carries each assignment by ID through save/load, a missing
//   field loads as no group, and an assignment to a group the file never
//   defined refuses the whole document before any of its Agents is taken in
//   assigning and clearing work while the simulation runs, mark the document
//   modified, and commit exactly one undoable document edit each; a refused
//   operation commits none
//   the real Group cell renders inside a CPU-side ImGui context without
//   leaking a disabled scope, paused or running
//   a group name carrying "##" - embedded, leading, or tripled - reaches the
//   screen in full, in the list and in the preview, and its row is still the
//   control for its own Agent group (#124)
//   grouping an Agent changes nothing about how it moves, what its runtime
//   snapshot says, or what events its run publishes
