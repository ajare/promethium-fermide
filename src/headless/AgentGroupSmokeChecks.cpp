// Agent group identity, naming, ordering, persistence, and undo, for ticket #109.
//
// Everything here crosses the two seams that matter: the public World
// authoring API, and a complete World serialize/deserialize round trip. The
// registry behind the API is never inspected, and the YAML is only read as a
// whole document - never asserted against incidental formatting.
//
// What gets pinned down:
//
//   the World owns each group under a stable, monotonically allocated ID,
//   and hands out no way to change a group around its own validation
//   names arrive trimmed, blank and overlong names are refused with a reason,
//   and uniqueness is case-sensitive
//   groups enumerate in creation order, before and after a rename
//   a refused create or rename changes nothing at all
//   version 9 carries the ordered IDs and names through save/load; versions
//   below 9 load with no groups, and a reader capped at 8 refuses 9 instead
//   of quietly dropping the groups
//   malformed version-9 input refuses the whole file and leaves the target
//   World holding exactly what it held before
//   adding and renaming work while the simulation runs, mark the document
//   modified, and commit exactly one undoable document edit each; a refused
//   or cancelled edit commits none
//   the real panel renders inside a CPU-side ImGui context without leaking a
//   disabled scope, paused or running
