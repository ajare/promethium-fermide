// Window Layer rules, for ticket #20.
//
// A Window joins the Layer it is authored on to the Layer directly behind it.  A
// Window on the back-most Layer has nothing behind it: it pairs with no Layer, so
// it never reaches the Graph and can never be pathed through.  The core now
// refuses to author one, the editor inherits that refusal as its drop
// diagnostic, and a Layer deletion which would strand one on the new back-most
// Layer deletes it instead.  Maps saved before the rule can still replay such a
// Window unchanged - the Layer deletion is what clears them.
