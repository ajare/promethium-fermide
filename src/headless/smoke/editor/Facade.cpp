// The editor surface for Facades, for ticket #47.
//
// The panel and the palette tray are not reachable headlessly, so these checks
// mirror what the editor does: the paint flow plays the same validate-then-add
// sequence the palette's drag release performs, the colour edit crosses the
// same 0..1 float triple the panel's ColorEdit3 edits and lands through the
// same World::setFacadeColour call, and the wall refusal is the diagnostic
// the wall editor would surface against a Facade - which the Facade panel never
// opens, because a Facade has no walls to edit.
//
// What gets pinned down:
//
//   the creation flow places an occupiable, selectable Facade with the Room's
//   placement validation - occupied cells refuse, free cells land
//   a colour edit persists through the construction record: the saved YAML
//   carries the new packed colour and a reload replays it
//   a recolour touches nothing but the Facade it was aimed at
//   the Background and Facade recolour paths do not cross types
//   a Facade can be resized and moved while retaining colour, open ends,
//   hosted objects, Agents, and its persisted footprint
//   wall add/remove against a Facade refuse with a clear, Facade-naming
//   diagnostic, both through the can-check and through the throwing command
//   the Selection panel's gates hold: a Facade is selectable, and no wall
//   affordance on any level or side would be actionable
//   the canvas drop targets - the pegman's Agent drop and a selected
//   Agent's drag-move - accept a Facade exactly as they accept a Room
