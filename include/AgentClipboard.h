// Agent clipboard payloads and Agent placement (ticket #113).
//
// An Agent's clipboard payload carries its Agent group by *name*, never by
// its World-local AgentGroupId: an AgentGroupId means nothing outside the
// World that issued it, while the name is what a destination World can
// either match against a group it already defines or create for itself
// (ADR 0006).
//
// The name is resolved at placement rather than at parse, because a paste is
// deferred - the Agent falls from the cursor and may be cancelled on the way
// down - and a cancelled paste must leave no group behind. So the payload
// keeps the name as written, arming judges it against the same naming rule
// the Agent group panels use, and only the landing writes: the group when the
// destination does not already define that name, the Agent, and the
// assignment, all as exactly one document edit.
//
// Agent tags obey a different boundary: their stable IDs are meaningful only
// under one external registry UUID. Tagged payloads therefore carry that UUID,
// the complete assignment set, and exact modifier samples with provenance.
// Only a World with the same attached registry UUID may accept them;
// untagged payloads omit all registry state and remain portable.
//
// This lives in its own translation unit - as the Agent group panels did in
// #109 and #110 - so the headless smoke checks drive the same encode, parse
// and place code the GUI calls rather than a mirrored copy, and UI.cpp's
// spdlog/nfd dependencies never link headlessly.
