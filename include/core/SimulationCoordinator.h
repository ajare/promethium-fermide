	// Runs the simulation on behalf of the World that owns it.

	// World keeps the world structure and owns every entity registry
	// (ADR 0001), and remains the facade (design pattern, not the Facade sector
	// type of ADR 0003) through which every caller - Agent included - reaches
	// simulation behaviour. The coordinator is where that behaviour lives:
	// traversal request and permit lifecycle, queue tickets and queue positions,
	// door/lift/shuttle/platform-lift/extensible allocation, interactions and
	// device operations, agent lifecycle, and the tick pipeline.
	//
	// ADR 0004 moves that behaviour in staged, leaf-first increments so each
	// stage builds green. The coordinator owns no state: it works on World's
	// registries through the World it was given, and calls back through the
	// World facade for machinery which has not moved out of World yet.
	//
	// The name deliberately avoids "controller", which CONTEXT.md bans, and
	// echoes ADR 0001's traversal-coordination vocabulary while covering the
